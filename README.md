### Hey there General Aseembly peeps. 
##### Thanks for checking out my work. I did two versions of this this challenge.

<br>
The first just focused on the minimum requirements with no styling. It's left this way as it would be easier for students to read without trying layer on CSS and Bootstrap. You can check out the interface on heroku here: <br>
<br>
##### But wait, it's way cooler on this page:

Here I added a custom boostrap theme and made things look, well, awesome. There is definitely more code, linked files and other mumbo jumbo to decifer.  In the end, I think presenting both to students would work well. Adavnced studnets could spend time learning styling and less experienced students would have a bit of hope that they aren't just learning ruby and javascript to create ugly pages.

## WDI Instructor Code Challenge

### GOAL 

> Create a single page application that will utilize an external API to request movie data. The client side application will be served by a back-end which will have the ability to persist data.


#### Back-end Instructions

- Within this repo you will have noticed two folders entitled `node-backend-starter-code` and `ruby-backend-starter-code`. Each of these contains similar back-ends written in frameworks respective to their languages - Sinatra for Ruby and Express for Node.

- Please **choose one** of the back-ends before you proceed. Feel free to pick whichever language you feel more comfortable in.

- Both back-ends contain several errors that commonly made by students, so you will need to do some debugging to ensure they are working correctly.

#### Front-end Instructions

- Use Vanilla Javascript to complete.

- The page should have a form that uses the [OMDBapi](http://www.omdbapi.com/) to search for matching movies and then display the results.
 - *Example*: If a user searches for `Star Wars`, a list of every Star Wars movie will be displayed.

- When the user clicks on a search result display detailed information about that movie.
  - *Example*: If a user is viewing a list of every Star Wars movie and clicks on `Star Wars: A New Hope`, detailed information about that specific movie will be displayed.

- Users should be able to "favorite" a movie and have it persisted via the provided back-end.

- Provide a link to display favorited movies.

#### Things we are looking for

- Clear, simple code
- Explanatory comments for beginners
- Consistent Naming Conventions
- Valid HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

#### Deliverables

- Please send us back a link to a git repo with the completed code challenge. 

- Include a README.md file in your repo with a link to your application deployed on Heroku or Digital Ocean.

#### Bonus

- Rewrite the application using a JavaScript MVC library. Include a readme that explains the benefits and any additional challenges students would face learning the library
